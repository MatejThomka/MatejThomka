## 🚀 About Me
I’m a backend-focused software engineer with nearly two years of industry experience  
(currently at **AT&T**) working on enterprise-grade distributed systems.

My core expertise revolves around **Java 21 and Spring Boot** while leveraging  
modern cloud and DevOps practices to deploy, scale and operate applications in production.

I love designing well-structured APIs, exploring distributed systems,  
and continuously learning new technologies to sharpen my craft.

- Creating and reviewing **Pull Requests** within enterprise teams
- **Practical experience with Git submodules**  
  (one parent repository controlling multiple feature/service repos directly in IntelliJ IDEA)
- Ability to **build reusable Maven modules/libraries** for internal consumption  
  and integrate them across microservices
- **SCRUM & Agile delivery experience**  
  (daily standups, sprint planning, backlog refinement, retros)
